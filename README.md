🚍 PATH FINDER: AI-Driven Public Transportation System
Smart Mobility Solution for Tier-2 Cities (Inspired by SIH 2025 Problem Statement)
💡 Project Overview
Path Finder is an AI-enhanced, multi-role web application designed to solve the problem of unpredictable public transport and lack of real-time information in small cities and Tier-2 towns. Our system uses a lightweight, API-first approach and predictive modeling to deliver accurate Estimated Times of Arrival (ETA) to commuters, even in low-bandwidth environments.

The solution is split into three secure access roles: Commuter (User), Driver, and Admin, providing a comprehensive, end-to-end management tool.

Key Features (MVP)
Role-Based Access: Secure login for Commuter (user/1), Driver (driver/3), and Admin (admin/2).

Dynamic Route Planning: Users input start/destination and receive suggested routes sorted by total journey time, with AI-predicted ETAs.

Live Journey Tracking: Dedicated screen showing bus position (simulated map), remaining stops, and estimated time to destination.

Crowdedness Indicator: Drivers manually update bus load (LIGHT, MODERATE, HEAVY), improving commuter safety and comfort.

Low-Bandwidth Optimized: The application logic (React.js) uses minimal API payloads and a simple, clean UI to ensure fast loading times on mobile devices.

🛠️ Technical Stack
Component

Technology

Role

Backend/API

Python (Flask)

REST API hosting, data serving, and core application logic.

AI/ML

Scikit-learn, Joblib

Linear/Ridge Regression models for accurate ETA prediction (trained on synthetic data).

Frontend

React.js (JavaScript)

Single-page application (SPA) providing the dynamic, responsive UI/UX.

Styling

Data Simulation

Numpy/Pandas

Used to generate massive historical and real-time mock data streams.

📂 Project Structure
This project uses a flat directory structure for stability, serving the frontend files directly from the root.

🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps precisely to set up and launch the application locally.

1. Installation
Install all required Python dependencies using pip:

py -m pip install Flask scikit-learn pandas numpy

2. AI Model Training (Crucial)
Before running the server, the AI models must be trained. This command generates the required .pkl files:

py ai_models.py

3. Launch the Application
Start the Flask development server:

py run_app.py

4. Access the Interface
Open your web browser and navigate to:
